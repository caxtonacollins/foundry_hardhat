# Solidity Visibility Modifiers
Visibility modifiers in Solidity control how other contracts and external accounts can interact with a contract's functions and state variables.  They are crucial for data encapsulation and security.  Here's a breakdown of the common modifiers:

1. `public`
    - **Access:** Accessible externally (from other contracts and externally owned accounts (EOAs)) and internally (within the contract itself and derived contracts).
    - **Use Cases:** Functions that are intended to be called by anyone, including other contracts and users. State variables (less common, generally discouraged for security reasons).

    - **Example:**

```solidity
contract Example {
    uint public myPublicVariable;
    function setMyPublicVariable(uint _value) public {
        myPublicVariable = _value;
    }
}
```

2. `private`
    - **Access:** Only accessible within the contract itself. Derived contracts cannot access private members.
    - **Use Cases:** Storing sensitive data or implementing internal logic that should not be exposed or modified externally.

    - **Example:**

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    uint private myPrivateVariable;

    function myFunction() public {
        myPrivateVariable = 20; // Accessible here
        _anotherPrivateFunction(); // Accessible here
    }

    function _anotherPrivateFunction() private {
        // ... internal logic
    }
}

contract AnotherContract {
    MyContract myContract;

    function tryAccess() public {
        // myContract.myPrivateVariable;  // This will cause a compiler error
        // myContract._anotherPrivateFunction(); // This will also cause a compiler error
    }
}
```

3. `internal`
    - **Access:** Accessible within the contract itself and derived contracts. Not accessible externally.
    - **Use Cases:** Functions and state variables that should be accessible within the contract and its derived contracts, but not from outside.

    - **Example:**

```solidity
contract BaseContract {
    uint internal myInternalVariable;

    function _myInternalFunction() internal {
        myInternalVariable = 30;
    }
}

contract DerivedContract is BaseContract {
    function myFunction() public {
        myInternalVariable = 40; // Accessible here
        _myInternalFunction(); // Accessible here
    }
}

contract AnotherContract {
    DerivedContract derivedContract;

    function tryAccess() public {
        // derivedContract.myInternalVariable; // This will cause a compiler error
        // derivedContract._myInternalFunction(); // This will also cause a compiler error
    }
}
```

4. `external`
    - **Access:** Accessible externally (from other contracts and externally owned accounts (EOAs)) and internally (within the contract itself and derived contracts).
    - **Use Cases:** Functions that are specifically designed to be called by other contracts or users. Often used for gas optimization because they pass data differently than internal functions. Requires careful consideration of data encoding.

    - **Example:**

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    uint public myPublicVariable;

    function myFunction() external {
        myPublicVariable = 20; // Accessible here
        this._anotherExternalFunction(); // Accessible here
    }

    function _anotherExternalFunction() external {
        // ... external logic
    }
}

contract AnotherContract {
    MyContract myContract;

    function tryAccess() public {
        myContract.myPublicVariable = 30; // Accessible here
        myContract.myFunction(); // Accessible here
    }
}
```
